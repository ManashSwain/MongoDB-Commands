## MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular open-source, NoSQL database management system that stores data in a flexible, document-oriented format called BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making it highly scalable, performant, and suitable for modern application development. It came from the word "Humongous".

# SQL vs MongoDB

A comparison between SQL and MongoDB to help understand their differences.

| **Aspect**                 | **SQL (Relational Databases)**                               | **MongoDB (NoSQL Database)**                          |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Model**             | Relational, table-based (rows and columns).                 | Document-oriented, uses BSON (JSON-like) documents.   |
| **Schema**                 | Fixed schema; structure must be defined beforehand.         | Schema-less; allows dynamic fields and flexibility.   |
| **Query Language**         | SQL (Structured Query Language).                            | MongoDB Query Language (MQL), JavaScript-based.       |
| **Relationships**          | Uses joins to relate tables.                                | Embeds or references documents to handle relations.   |
| **Scaling**                | Vertical scaling (adding resources to a single server).     | Horizontal scaling (sharding across servers).         |
| **Transaction Support**    | Full ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). | ACID compliance for multi-document transactions introduced in later versions. |
| **Performance**            | Optimized for structured data with complex queries.         | Faster for unstructured or semi-structured data.      |
| **Use Cases**              | Banking, e-commerce, and systems requiring complex relationships. | Real-time analytics, IoT, and applications with evolving schemas. |
| **Examples of Databases**  | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB, Microsoft SQL Server.         | MongoDB, Couchbase, Cassandra.                       |

# JSON vs BSON: A Comparison

This document provides a comparison between JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and BSON (Binary JSON), highlighting their differences, advantages, and use cases.

---

## **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**

### **Overview**
- JSON is a lightweight, text-based data interchange format.
- It is easy for humans to read and write, and for machines to parse and generate.
- JSON is widely used in web APIs and configuration files.

### **Key Features**
1. **Human-Readable**: Stored as plain text, making it easy to understand and debug.
2. **Interoperability**: Supported across multiple programming languages.
3. **Simple Data Types**: Includes basic types like strings, numbers, arrays, and objects.

### **Example**
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "isEmployed": true,
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "Python", "SQL"]
}

```

# BSON (Binary JSON)

BSON (Binary JSON) is a binary-encoded serialization format used primarily to store documents and make remote procedure calls in MongoDB. It extends JSON's capabilities, providing additional data types and a more efficient storage mechanism.

---

## **Key Features of BSON**

### 1. **Binary Encoding**
- BSON stores data in a compact binary format, making it smaller and faster to process than plain JSON.
- It reduces the overhead of transmitting or storing large datasets.

### 2. **Rich Data Types**
- Supports additional types not available in standard JSON, including:
  - `Date`
  - `Binary`
  - `ObjectId`
  - `Decimal128`
- These types simplify handling complex data in applications.

### 3. **Fast Parsing**
- BSON is optimized for high-speed parsing and encoding/decoding.
- Its structure allows efficient traversal and manipulation, especially in database operations.

### 4. **Efficient Storage**
- BSON is designed for efficient storage, with features like length prefixes for quick access to fields.
- It supports embedded documents and arrays, maintaining the hierarchical structure of data.

---

## **Data Types Supported by BSON**

| **Data Type**   | **Description**                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `String`        | UTF-8 encoded string.                            |
| `Integer`       | 32-bit and 64-bit integers for numeric values.    |
| `Date`          | Stores dates in milliseconds since the epoch.    |
| `Binary`        | Stores binary data, such as images or files.     |
| `ObjectId`      | Unique identifier for documents in MongoDB.      |
| `Decimal128`    | High-precision decimal numbers.                  |
| `Array`         | Stores ordered lists of values.                  |
| `Embedded Doc`  | Nested documents within a parent document.       |
| `Boolean`       | Stores `true` or `false`.                        |

---

## **Example of BSON Structure**

```json
{
  "_id": { "$oid": "unique_id_12345" },
  "name": "Alice Johnson",
  "age": { "$numberInt": "25" },
  "createdAt": { "$date": "2024-11-23T10:15:30Z" },
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "Python", "MongoDB"],
  "profilePicture": { "$binary": "binary_data", "$type": "00" }
}

## commands

To check the  MongoDB version

```bash
  mongod --version
```

To start mongoDB Server

```bash
  mongosh
```


## Viewing Databases

```javascript

show dbs;
```

## Alternative command to list all databases

```javascript

show databases;
```

## Switch to a specific database (or create it if it doesn't exist)

```javascript

use databasename;
```

- This can also create a new database .
- If database is not present it will create a new database.
- If there are no collections it will not show.


## Drop the current database

```javascript

db.dropDatabase();
```

## Show all collections in the current database

```javascript

show collections;
```

## Create a new collection

```javascript

db.createCollection("collection-name");
```

## Drop a specific collection

```javascript

db.collectionName.drop();
```

## Insert one document into a collection

```javascript

db.collectionName.insertOne({
    field1: value1,
    field2: value2
});
```

## Insert multiple documents into a collection

```javascript

db.collectionName.insertMany([
    {
        field1: value1,
        field2: value2
    },
    {
        field1: value1,
        field2: value2
    }
]);

```

## Insert multiple documents in an unordered manner

```javascript

db.collectionName.insertMany([
    { field1: value1,
     field2: value2 },
    { field1: value1, 
    field2: value2 }
], { ordered: false });

```

## Case Sensitivity in MongoDB

### Below two commands are different as the first command will  insert the document in Products collection and the second command will insert the document in the products collection.

### Note : Products collection and products collection are different.

```javascript

db.Products.insertOne({
    field1: value1,
    field2: value2
});
```

```javascript

db.products.insertOne({
    field1: value1,
    field2: value2
});
```
